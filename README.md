# AI-for-De-novo-Peptide-Drug-Design
Designed antimicrobial peptides targeting beta-lactamase using deep learning (Transformers, RF Diffusion, GNNs). Validated peptides via structure prediction (AlphaFold2/RosettaFold), docking (AutoDock v4.2.6), and MD simulations (GROMACS), showing stable interactions for AMR drug discovery.
